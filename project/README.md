# Nearby shops project

This application will allow users to view the nearby shops and also the possibility to like and dislike them.

## Backend 

I choosed to use Java JEE to deploy the backend of this application, with the combination of spring framework, the spring security infrastructure and JWT (JSON WEB TOKENS), it will be easy to secure the access.
